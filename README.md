## Need help?
If you'd like to get started with Stream, but not a technical guru on the set up, we can lend a hand and get you up and running in no time. Unfortunately, there is an initial set up fee and depending on whether you need us to host Stream, will be an on-going cost.

#### Cost matrix

Stream type | set up | on-going | photos
--- |:---:|:---:|:---:|
Personal | $9 | $9.99 | 500
Commercial | $29 | $29.99 | 750

##### What about a custom domain?
If you supply us a name to search for, we'll find the best top three results and send back to you to consider, if there is one you like, we'll purchase on your behalf and also set up to point to your new stream, the cost for this is $50.

##### Alternatively, you can opt for a custom URL

If you only want to test trial Stream without a domain, you can do this as well by using a custom URL, e.g. puffstream.com/s/yourstream
