Photos and posts streaming software, open source.

#### Here's what I'll be placing my efforts on next:
- Uploading videos to YouTube to talk about Building Software for SaaS (Software as a Service)
- Completing Cloud Module (private) for end-users to join up and try Stream
- Updating readme.md for better installation instructions
- Taking a short breather
