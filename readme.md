### Looking for our legacy code? ###
[git clone -b legacy-code --single-branch https://github.com/puffstream/stream.git](https://github.com/puffstream/stream/tree/legacy-code)

#### What happened to the previous code? ####
What's that quote? 1 Step back, 2 steps forward? That's the one. Before I can really charge ahead with the Stream Project, I need to have a clear understanding of what Stream is, what it isn't. For example, Stream isn't a News feed. I think that's one of the main issues with the legacy code was that it was still conforming to a News feed where the context of Stream is set apart from this. If your interested in the Stream topic, feel free to follow me on my [Blog](https://streamwebcontent.wordpress.com/).

In the mean-time I've put up some placeholder text and images that might seem somewhat unrelated. But their just placeholders for now :/ Sorry about that.

Some inspiration while you wait :) Meet Paul, our Spaceman.
